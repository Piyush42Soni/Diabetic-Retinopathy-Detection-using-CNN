## Problem Description
Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). If someone have diabetes, itâ€™s important to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year.

DR Severity Level | Lesions 
--- | --- 
No DR |	Absent of lesions
Mild non-proliferative DR |	MA only
Moderate non-proliferative DR |	(More than just MA but less than severe DR
Severe non-proliferative DR	Any of the following: | more than 20 intraretinal HM in each of 4 quadrants, definite venous beading in 2+ quadrants, prominent intraretinal microvascular abnormalities in 1+ quadrant and no signs of proliferative DR)

## Task
Predict whether diabetic retinopathy is referenceable (NPDR {Moderate or beyond} or DPR with NDE) or not.

## Model

I have created a deep learning model that uses the **CNN model** for the binary classification of diabetic retinopathy. Here are the results generated (average of 10 trials) :
1. The average **accuracy of the model is 98.04%.**
2. f1 score of 0.985
3. The precision for output 1 is 1.00.
4. The precision for output 0 is 0.97.
5. recall for output 0 is 1.00
6. The recall for output 1 is 0.97.
7. **sensitivity is 1**
 
I have observed that the data was imbalanced; therefore, I have used oversampling using **SMOTE** to make the data balanced in both cases. Also, I have used data **augmentation and normalization** for better training of the model and to prevent overfitting. I have used the **Adam optimization technique** and the **binary cross-entropy loss function.**
 
Then I have compared my CNN model with an ANN and a Naive Bayesian model, and here are the results:
 
ANN Model
I have used SMOTE oversampling, data augmentation, and data normalization, but it does not affect the results of ANN.
1. Accuracy is 50%.
2. The sensitivity is 0.
 
Naive Bayesian Model
1. The average accuracy of test data is 60%.
2. f1 score of 0.57
